## Lab1 - create EC2

In this Lab, you will create a EC2 using Terraform.

## Create .tf file
1. Open `ec2.tf` on Visual Studio Code.

2. Edit `ec2.tf` as follows then save the file.

```
provider "aws" {
    profile = "terraform"
    region = "ap-southeast-2"
}

variable "datadog_api_key" {}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami = "ami-0954a49a9348487cc"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-0774fd50ef028439a"]
  key_name = "<YOUR KEY PAIR from Lab0>"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-workshop-name". //Any name is ok, but please make sure it is recognizable as yours!
  }

  user_data = <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY="${var.datadog_api_key}" DD_SITE="datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
EOF
 
}
output "ec2_instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.ec2.id
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.ec2.public_ip
}
```

## Running terraform

1. Open the terminal in VS Code from `Terminal` >> `new Terminal` (Or you can use terminal/iTerm2 on your Mac!)

2. Change current directory 
```
$ cd Lab1-EC2
```

3. initialize terraform

```
$ terraform init 
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Take a look `Terraform has been successfully initialized!` is appeared.

4. Run Terraform to create ec2.

```
$ terraform apply -var-file ../terraform.tfvars
```

you can see the execution plan.

```
aws_instance.ec2: Refreshing state... [id=i-03af36e2fb6fc90c5]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following

Changes to Outputs:
  ~ ec2_instance_id = (known after apply)
  ~ public_ip       = (known after apply)

```

5.  Enter `yes`
```
message:
  Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

```

6. Make sure your EC2 has been created.

	*Please note `instance_id` and `public_ip`!*
```
aws_instance.ec2: Creating...
aws_instance.ec2: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2: Creation complete after 17s [id=i-0fcf16927ac8669c6]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ec2_instance_id = "i-03af36e2fb6fxxxxx"
public_ip = "3.25.124.xxx"
```

[AWS Console link](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=ap-southeast-2#Instances:instanceState=running)

7. connect to your ec2 via SSH then confirm your datadog agent is active.
  
```
$ ssh -i "YOUR-SSH-KEY.pem" root@ec2-35-xx-xxx-xxx.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

8. Open the Datadog on your browser, and you can see your EC2 host in the [Infrastructure List](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure).

### *Hands-on EC2 is completed. The next is Create Monitor. â†’ [Lab2](./../Lab2-Monitor/README.md)*
